# odin-etch-a-sketch

In this project, I am going to build a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch.
A couple of the skills demonstrated in this project include flexbox and DOM manipulation.

## Features:

- Pressing the 'new sketch' button will prompt for a new size of the grid, allowing up to 100 x 100 pixels
- Hovering over an empty square paints it to a random color.
